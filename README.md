# IncreaseAMYield
3D Printing + Machine Learning = Increase Part Yield

## Background Information
This experiment includes actual (not simulated) data from a metal 3D printing machine and thermal imaging sensor. 10 samples were built and tested.


## Print Parameters
Inputs into the printer prior to the building process.

## Melt Pool Metrics
A thermal imaging sensor captures images of the melting process, specifically the melt pool.

## Material Properties
The material property measured was porosity or (1 - Density).


## Business Goal
Increase the yield of the 3D printed components.

## Data Goal
1) Develop a connection between the three datasets.
2) With this understanding, control the Print Parameters, and have a boundary for the Melt Pool Metrics, so that porosity is as close to 0% as possible.
