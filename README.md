# Increase Additive Manufacturing Yield
3D Printing + Machine Learning = Increase Part Yield

## Background Information
This experiment includes actual (not simulated) data from a metal 3D printing machine and thermal imaging sensor. 10 samples were built and tested.

## Goals
### Business
Increase the return on investment (ROI) of the machine by increasing the yield of the 3D printed components.

### Data
1) Develop a connection between the three datasets.
2) With this understanding, control the Print Parameters, and have a boundary for the Melt Pool Metrics, so that porosity is as close to 0% as possible.

## Datasets
### Print Parameters
Inputs into the printer prior to the building process.

### Melt Pool Metrics
A thermal imaging sensor captures images of the melting process, specifically the melt pool.

### Material Properties
The material property measured was porosity or (1 - Density).

## Machine Learning
### Linear Regression
The act of fitting a line to two or more variables to show a linear relationship between them.

### Random Forest
Many decision trees are used to separate the data into groups to determine their outcomes.
